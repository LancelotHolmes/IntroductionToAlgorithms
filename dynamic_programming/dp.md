## Dynamic Programming

### Description
> A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblems just once and then saves its answer in a table,thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem

Keywords: *tabular method*,*optimization problems*

### Steps:
* Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
* Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
* Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion
* Construct an optimal solution from computed information
